## Introduction

VeeVee is a validation plugin built for Vue.js. VeeVee is heavily inspired by the validation that is provided in laravel, and other similar validation plugins for javascript.  
VeeVee was created to reflect as close to possible the laravel validation rules on the client side. Extensibility is key with VeeVee and it was designed with customisability in mind.  

VeeVee can be used on any HTML5 input, as well as any custom Vue components. VeeVee also comes with an inbuilt localization, currently there is only the english localization.
